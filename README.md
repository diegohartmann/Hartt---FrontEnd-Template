# Hartt
## is a front-end 'start-template' project.
### all files are inside the 'public' folder.


I's a project template I used to use for my initial projects, which contains the Hartt Libs, that are:

1. a __hartt.js__ file (with pre-made importable useful functions);

2. and a __hartt.css__ file (with pre-made css classes and a complete style reset);


## This template (as well as its libs files) are completly free for you to use :)
