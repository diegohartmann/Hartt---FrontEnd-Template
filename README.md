# Hartt
## is a front-end 'start-template' project.

I's a project template I used to use for my initial projects. All files are inside 'public' folder

## Assets:
1. _hartt.js_ (JavaScript libray --> pre-made importable useful functions);
2. _hartt.css_ (CSS framework --> pre-made classes [and a complete style reset!] );
3. _fontAwasome.js_ (JavaScript file that gives you access to use <i></i> tags inside html document, for add icons. More on: https://fontawesome.com/v5/search);


## This template (as well as its libs files) are completly free for you to use :)
