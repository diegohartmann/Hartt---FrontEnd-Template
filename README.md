# Lobo.js, a JavaScript library for fluid and fast development.
Lobo.js is a simple JavaScript file containing a pack of functions which will improve your development flow.


## Setup
0) copy the 'lobo.js' file (from the folder in which this 'readme' document is contained);
1) paste it inside your project's 'js' folder (or wherever you want);

## Use
2) import it by writing the following line on the top of the script you are calling Lobo.js: import L from './lobo.js';
3) make sure the script that is importing lobo.js has the 'type=module' property, like this: <script type="module" src="js/script.js"></script> 
4) now, you can access any of its functions by calling the L object, just like: L.isEven(_n), or L.replaceAll('a','b');


# Enjoy!
