# Hartt.js, a JavaScript library for fluid and fast development.
Hartt.js is a simple JavaScript file containing a pack of functions which will improve your development flow.

## Setup
0) copy the 'Hartt.js' file (from the folder in which this 'readme' document is contained);
1) paste it inside your project's 'js' folder (or wherever you want);

## Use
2) make sure the script (in which you intend to import Hartt.js's functions) has the 'type=module' property, like this:<script type="module" src="js/script.js"></script> 
3) now, you can access any of its functions by importing their name, just like: import {isEven, replaceAll} from './Hart.js'; 


# Enjoy!
